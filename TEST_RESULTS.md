## Issues Found
1. catalog-api has severe compilation issues preventing tests from running.
2. catalog-web had one failing test due to missing QueryClientProvider (fixed).
3. Android projects lack proper test execution setup.

## Recommendations
1. Fix Go module imports and model definitions in catalog-api.
2. Ensure all React components using React Query are properly wrapped in tests.
3. Set up Gradle wrapper for Android projects to enable test execution.
