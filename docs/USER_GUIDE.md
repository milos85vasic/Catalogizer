## Introduction

Catalogizer is a multi-platform media collection manager that detects, categorizes, and organizes digital media across network storage protocols (SMB, FTP, NFS, WebDAV) and local filesystems. It consists of multiple client applications that connect to a central Go/Gin backend API:

- **catalog-web** -- React/TypeScript web frontend
- **catalogizer-desktop** -- Tauri (Rust + React) desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **catalogizer-android** -- Kotlin/Jetpack Compose mobile app for Android phones and tablets
- **catalogizer-androidtv** -- Kotlin/Compose app optimized for Android TV

All clients communicate with **catalog-api**, the backend server that handles media scanning, metadata enrichment (via TMDB, IMDB, and other providers), user authentication, subtitle management, format conversion, and real-time event streaming via WebSocket.

### Key Capabilities

- Automatic detection and categorization of movies, TV shows, music, documentaries, anime, and other media types
- Multi-protocol storage scanning: SMB/CIFS, FTP, NFS, WebDAV, and local paths
- Metadata enrichment from TMDB, IMDB, and other external providers
- Subtitle search, download, upload, and sync verification across multiple providers
- Media format conversion with job queue management
- Smart collections with rule-based automatic population
- Playlist creation and management with shuffle and sequential playback
- Favorites with import/export support
- AI-powered insights, categorization, and natural language search
- Real-time library updates via WebSocket
- Offline mode with automatic sync (Android)
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

### System Requirements

| Client | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|
| Web Browser | Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ |
| Desktop (Windows) | Windows 10 or later |
| Desktop (macOS) | macOS 11.0 or later |
| Desktop (Linux) | AppImage or .deb package compatible distribution |
| Android | Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher, 2 GB RAM minimum |

---

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Start the backend server.** If your administrator has already deployed the server, skip to step 3. Otherwise:

   ```bash
   cd catalog-api
   export JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-at-least-32-chars"
   export ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
   export ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-admin-password"
   go run main.go
   ```

2. **Start the web frontend** (for web access):

   ```bash
   cd catalog-web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the web application** at `http://localhost:5173` (development) or the URL provided by your administrator.

4. **Log in** with your username and password. If this is a fresh installation, use the admin credentials configured during server setup.

5. **Configure storage sources** from the Admin panel. Add paths to your media directories (local paths, SMB shares, FTP servers, etc.).

6. **Trigger a library scan** from the Dashboard using the "Scan Library" quick action. Catalogizer will discover and catalog all media files from your configured storage sources.

7. **Browse your media** in the Media Browser. Items are automatically categorized by type (movies, TV shows, music, etc.) with metadata fetched from external providers.

### Account Setup

After your first login:

1. Navigate to your profile settings (top-right corner of the web app).
2. Change the default password if you are using one provided by an administrator.
3. Review your notification and display preferences.
4. Set your preferred theme (Light, Dark, or System).

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid username or password"
- Verify your username spelling (case-sensitive).
- Check that Caps Lock is not enabled.
- Use the password reset feature if available.
- Clear browser cache and cookies, then try again.
- Try an incognito/private browsing window.

**Problem:** Session expired unexpectedly
- JWT tokens expire after the configured duration (default 24 hours).
- Log in again to obtain a new token.
- If this happens frequently, contact your administrator about session duration settings.

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** Cannot connect to the server
- Verify the server URL is correct (include `http://` or `https://`).
- Check that the server is running: `curl http://your-server:8080/health` should return `{"status":"healthy"}`.
- Verify firewall rules allow connections on the server port (default 8080).
- If using HTTPS, ensure the SSL certificate is valid and trusted.

**Problem:** WebSocket connection fails
- WebSocket requires the server to support the `Upgrade` header.
- If behind a reverse proxy (nginx), ensure WebSocket proxying is configured.
- Check that the browser is not blocking WebSocket connections.

### Media Not Appearing

**Problem:** Library scan does not find media files
- Verify storage sources are correctly configured in the Admin panel.
- For SMB shares, ensure credentials are correct and the share is accessible.
- Check file permissions on local paths.
- Verify supported file types are present (media files with common extensions).
- Trigger a manual re-scan from the Dashboard.

**Problem:** Metadata is missing or incorrect
- Metadata is fetched from external providers (TMDB, IMDB). Ensure API keys are configured if required.
- Some media files may not match any external database entry.
- File naming conventions affect detection accuracy. Consistent naming improves recognition.

### Upload Problems

**Problem:** Upload fails
- Check file size against the server's maximum (default: 5 GB archive, 1 MB chunk size).
- Verify the file format is supported.
- Test network connectivity.
- Clear browser cache and retry.
- Try uploading from a different browser.

**Problem:** Slow upload speeds
- Use a wired connection when possible.
- Upload during off-peak hours.
- Close other bandwidth-intensive applications.
- Upload files in smaller batches.

### Desktop App Issues

**Problem:** Blank white screen
- Check for JavaScript errors in the developer console (if accessible).
- Ensure the app is up to date.
- Clear app data and reconfigure.

**Problem:** Auto-start not working
- Verify the toggle is enabled in Settings.
- Linux: check `~/.config/autostart/` for the desktop entry.
- macOS: check System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items.
- Windows: check Task Manager > Startup tab.

### Android App Issues

**Problem:** App crashes on launch
- Ensure the device runs Android 8.0 or higher.
- Clear app data: Settings > Apps > Catalogizer > Storage > Clear Data.
- Update to the latest app version.
- If the issue persists, uninstall and reinstall.

**Problem:** Sync failures
- Check offline stats for failed sync operations.
- Verify the server is reachable.
- Force a manual sync when connectivity is stable.
- Log out and back in to refresh the authentication token.

**Problem:** Slow performance
- Clear app cache: Settings > Apps > Catalogizer > Storage > Clear Cache.
- Trigger cache cleanup if the local database has grown large.
- Ensure sufficient free storage on the device.

### Conversion Issues

**Problem:** Conversion job fails
- Check the job status for error details.
- Verify the source file is accessible and not corrupted.
- Ensure the target format is supported.
- Check server resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
- Retry the conversion.

### Subtitle Issues

**Problem:** No subtitle results found
- Try different search terms (exact movie title, year).
- Check that the selected language is correct.
- Try enabling additional subtitle providers.
- Verify network connectivity to external subtitle services.

**Problem:** Subtitle sync is off
- Use the Verify Sync feature to check timing.
- Adjust the sync offset in milliseconds.
- Try a different subtitle file from search results.
