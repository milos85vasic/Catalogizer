## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Media Entity System (Phases 1-10)
- Complete media entity aggregation pipeline: scanner post-scan hook triggers title parsing, MediaItem creation, hierarchy building, and duplicate detection
- 11 media types seeded in `media_types` table: movie, tv_show, tv_season, tv_episode, music_artist, music_album, song, game, software, book, comic
- Entity hierarchy with parent_id self-reference: TV Show -> seasons -> episodes, Music Artist -> albums -> songs
- Entity API (`/api/v1/entities`) with 17 endpoints: list, get, children, files, metadata, duplicates, stream, download, install-info, browse by type, entity types, entity stats, duplicate groups, user metadata, metadata refresh
- Title parser (`internal/services/title_parser.go`) with regex-based extraction for movie, TV, music, game, and software naming conventions
- AggregationService (`internal/services/aggregation_service.go`) for post-scan entity creation with automatic hierarchy building
- MediaItemRepository, MediaFileRepository, ExternalMetadataRepository, UserMetadataRepository, DirectoryAnalysisRepository for entity data access
- Entity browser frontend components in `catalog-web`: browse page, entity detail page, type-based navigation
- User metadata system: user ratings, watch status, favorites, personal notes, and tags per entity

#### Asset Management System
- Asset management submodule (`digital.vasic.assets`) integrated for cover art, thumbnails, and media artwork
- Lazy asset resolution pipeline: request -> background resolution -> WebSocket notification -> client refresh
- Three asset resolvers chained: CachedFileResolver, ExternalMetadataResolver, LocalScanResolver
- Default placeholder provider via `defaults.NewEmbeddedProvider()` for assets pending resolution
- Asset serving endpoint (`GET /api/v1/assets/:id`) with `X-Asset-Status` header (ready/pending)
- Asset event bridge: asset resolution events broadcast to WebSocket clients for real-time UI updates

#### Challenge-Based Testing Framework (CH-001 to CH-020)
- `digital.vasic.challenges` Go submodule for structured test scenario definition and execution
- 20 challenges covering infrastructure (CH-001 to CH-003), browsing (CH-004 to CH-005), assets (CH-006 to CH-007), auth (CH-008), scanning/storage (CH-009 to CH-015), and entity system (CH-016 to CH-020)
- Challenge REST API (`/api/v1/challenges`) with list, get, run single, run all, run by category, and get results endpoints
- Progress-based liveness detection with 5-minute stale threshold
- 117 assertions across all 20 challenges, all passing

#### Container Discovery Submodule
- `digital.vasic.containers` Go submodule for TCP-based service discovery
- Dynamic port binding: API server finds available port at startup, writes to `.service-port` file
- Frontend dev server reads `.service-port` for automatic API proxy configuration

#### Submodule Architecture
- 10 actively integrated Go submodules via `replace` directives in `go.mod`: Challenges, Assets, Containers, Concurrency, Config, Filesystem, Auth, Cache, Entities, EventBus
- 9 TypeScript/React submodules linked via `file:../` in `catalog-web/package.json`
- ADR-002 documenting submodule integration decisions and exclusion rationale for 10 unused Go submodules

#### HTTP/3 (QUIC) Support
- HTTP/3 server on UDP port 8443 via `quic-go/http3`
- HTTPS/HTTP2 server on TCP port 8443 as fallback
- Self-signed TLS certificate generation at startup for development
- Alt-Svc header advertising HTTP/3 availability to clients
- Brotli compression middleware (`andybalholm/brotli`) for all API responses

#### Advanced Statistics
- 9 statistics endpoints under `/api/v1/stats`: overall, per-storage-root, file types, size distribution, duplicates, duplicate groups, access patterns, growth trends, scan history
- Media browse endpoints (`/api/v1/media/search`, `/api/v1/media/stats`) backed by real database queries

#### Frontend Component Library
- React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Zustand
- Entity browser with type-based navigation, grid/list views, and entity detail pages
- Collection manager UI with create, edit, delete operations
- Dashboard analytics page with statistics visualization
- Media player components with subtitle support
- Path aliases: `@/components`, `@/hooks`, `@/lib`, `@/types`, `@/services`, `@/store`, `@/pages`, `@/assets`
- Build output split into vendor chunks: vendor (react), router, ui, charts, utils

#### Documentation (Phase 6)
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification (`docs/api/openapi.yaml`) covering all `/api/v1/*` endpoints with Bearer JWT auth, request/response schemas, and proper HTTP status codes
- ADR-001: Dual Database Dialect (SQLite + PostgreSQL abstraction)
- ADR-002: Submodule Architecture and Integration Decisions
- ADR-003: HTTP/3 (QUIC) with Brotli Compression Requirement
- ADR-004: Challenge-Based Testing Framework
- ADR-005: Container-Only Build and Runtime Policy
- ADR-006: Zero Warning / Zero Error Policy
- Comprehensive CHANGELOG entries for all post-1.0.0 work

### Changed
- Database migrations expanded to 8 versions (v7 = challenge/scan tables, v8 = media entity tables)
- Universal scanner enhanced with post-scan aggregation hook for automatic entity creation
- Config precedence clarified: env vars > `.env` > `config.json` > defaults
- Challenge runner timeout set to 72 hours with 5-minute stale threshold for stuck detection
- `config.json` `write_timeout` increased to 900 seconds to support long-running challenge RunAll operations
- Containerized build pipeline uses `--network host` for SSL reliability

### Deprecated

### Removed
- 21 unused Go/Android submodules cleaned up (Auth, Cache, Database, Discovery, Media, Middleware, Observability, RateLimiter, Security, Storage, Streaming, Watcher, and Android-specific modules)
- Deprecated `smb_roots` table references replaced by `storage_roots` multi-protocol table

### Fixed
- Database schema and scanner foreign key issues in entity tables
- Auth mock types, API key generation, and LoginResponse field mismatches in test suite
- All failing tests resolved: Go 35/35 packages pass, Frontend 102/102 files (1643 tests) pass
- All 20 challenges passing with 117/117 assertions

### Security
- JWT secret generation: cryptographically secure random secret generated at startup when not configured
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with per-user salt
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 requests/minute) and general API (100 requests/minute)
- Input validation middleware with configurable rules
- Request ID middleware for audit trail correlation
- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting (optional, falls back to in-memory)
